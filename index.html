    <h1>Master of Developing on 13"</h1>
    <p>
      I have been studying and developing for several years now on my own time, mostly on personal projects and tech startups. It's what I truly enjoy doing and only just recently decided that I should move toward making it a career. In the last month I completed a few online courses on Java, Javascript and Bootstrap.  My focus now is creating impressive sites to continue to build, and be able to display, my hard skills. with the end goal to get to the next level of becoming a valuable developer and team member.
    </p>
    <h1>Technology Experience</h1>
    <p>
      I am comfortable with WordPress, having developed several websites on the platform and I have experience building with Joomla as well. I set up and managed multiple online carts on platforms like CS Cart, Volusion and several shopping venues (Amazon, EBay, Yahoo, Sears, etc.) and later on, was in charge of loading 40K+ SKU’s to ChannelAdvisor and mapping the data to feed to these shopping channels.  
    </p>
    <h1>Still learning Online</h1>
    <p>
      I have completed more than a few online courses, “Intro to Computer Science”, “Web Development” and “Intro to HTML and CSS” from the Udacity team. I also recently completed a “Java Tutorial for complete beginners” course from John Purcell on Udemy and the Javascript track on Code Academy.  
    </p>
    <h1>End to End</h1>
    <p>
      I have a django project that I started developing a while back that is a more complex website. It utilizes the bottlenose framework to work with the Amazon shopping api and displays results based on a given search input. The end result is meant to be an Amazon seller tool that would allow sellers to more easily view listing in a way to assist them on more competitive listings. This project still needs work and now that I have a better grasp on javascript I should be able to start moving on it again. I am continuing to build out my skillset and portfolio as I learn new technology. I have started learning bootstrap 3, and started building a chess game in java with a friend while focusing on using Github to become accustom to version control.

     <h1>What Else...</h1>

      I have been involved in a startup, Bizplot, which received some funding in early stages from a local accelerator, TechColumbus, and has yet to really amount to more than a hobby.  I have remained active in the local startup community with a tie to a local funding group.  I have more recently been consulting a startup, Jetfuel Technology, that is focused on wearable technology and data warehousing.

      "I remember sitting down early in the morning, when people really ought to be sleeping,  and spending hours online with an intro to computer science class.  Getting up at what I was told was a ridiculous hour, was effortless because I was finally learning something I loved to do."​
